# PB & J

## Ingredients:

### Bread

### Peanut Butter

### Jelly (Many options available, I prefer Raspberry)

## Directions: 

Take two slices of your choice of bread( ayyy lmao), spread an even layer of peanut butter on one slice, to your liking. Next take the other
slice of bread and repeat the same steps with the jelly. Take both slices of bread and lay one on top of another with the jelly/
peanut butter sides touching. You can be done at this point in the recipe, but if you would like you can cut the sandwich into 
easier to eat slices that is still an option. 

## Slicing Ideas:

Corner to corner

Four squares

Free from crust
